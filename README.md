# QR-AR
This is Project which I developed in just 20mins. This is an AR Android Application, which uses Image Target as a feature and overlays a Video of the Image. This is a Application developed for a 3D-Doodler Design book just in a very short time of 20mins in order to see how it works. I have used Vuforia as the AR SDK for this application.
